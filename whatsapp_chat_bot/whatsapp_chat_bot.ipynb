It’s just the adult thing to do rather than scheme loads of options lol as if she’s a child. plus it means the responsibility comes off your back. He says just say something like, obviously you know I love you and I’ve really wanted to help by giving you this space for you to clear your mind and have a bit of solace away from family etc. But now that it’s been a month I think it’s time to really think seriously about your next steps in terms of moving out, getting a job and either going to a rented flat or going home. I would recommend that you just get a retail job, if you don’t want to go home, there are hundreds of shops around and you can just get something to carry you over and just get through this time, and that’s admirable. I hope this time has really helped you to bring clarity and space, what do you think about 2-3 weeks as a reasonable timeframe to sort something out and make a plan? i think no point giving the rent options meez for your flat because it’s unsustainable, she’s going to have to move out anyway soon and I dont think her cleanliness and tidy/ housemate stabdards will ever be good enough - unless you’re willing to actually consider her as a housemate then she should pay Guy’s rent if you want that to be an option - something like ‘I think because Guy is paying rent it’s just slightly unfair on him, but if you want to stay then obviously you can pay the rent and that way you can join as a housemate rather than a guest etc.’ )']\n",
